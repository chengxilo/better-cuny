## 😎 Features

### 📆 Export Schedule to CSV

On your Schedule Builder page, click the `EXPORT` button:

This will download a `.csv` file, which you can import into Google Calendar.

Unlike the default Schedule Builder, this extension provides **more accurate results** by combining data from your webpage and the official [CUNY Academic Calendar](https://www.cuny.edu/academics/academic-calendars/):

It accounts for special situations (like rescheduled classes) that the Schedule Builder might overlook.
<font style="color:red">However, this is based on webpage content — your professor and classmates are always more trustworthy sources for the most accurate information.</font>
